<p>IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY</p>
<p>Two license agreements are presented below.</p>
<ol>
<li>IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs</li>
<li>IBM International Program License Agreement</li>
</ol>
<p>If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing,
trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below,
Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.</p>
<p>If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy,"
or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button
below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
(the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program
License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.</p>
<p>The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.</p>
<p>The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or
obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement
agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).</p>
<p>The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and
each is independent of the other.</p>
<p>The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.</p>
<p>International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs</p>
<p>Part 1 - General Terms</p>
<p>BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE
USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS
ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO
THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED. IF THE
PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Authorized Use" - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the
Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units ("MSUs"),
Processor Value Units ("PVUs"), or other level of use specified by IBM.</p>
<p>"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>"License Information" ("LI") - a document that provides information and any additional
terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI can be found in the Program's directory, by the
use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.</p>
<p>"Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable
instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images,
text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).</p>
<ol>
<li>Agreement Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any) and the LI and
is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any
prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee's use of the Program.
The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI
prevails over both Parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>License Grant</li>
</ol>
<p>The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.</p>
<p>IBM grants Licensee a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to 1) download, install, and use
the Program during the evaluation period up to the Authorized Use specified in the LI solely for
internal evaluation, testing, or demonstration purposes on a trial basis; 2) make and install a
reasonable number of copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy, all provided that</p>
<p>a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;</p>
<p>b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;</p>
<p>c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial
copy, of the Program;</p>
<p>d. Licensee maintains a record of all copies of the Program and ensures that anyone who uses the Program
(accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee's behalf and 2) complies with
the terms of this Agreement;</p>
<p>e. Licensee does not 1) use the Program for productive purposes or otherwise use, copy, modify, or
distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse
compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law
without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program's components, files,
modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; 4) sublicense,
rent, or lease the Program; or 5) use the Program for commercial application hosting; and</p>
<p>f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support
the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or,
if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only
to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item
"f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM Program ("Principal
Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program's LI. (To obtain
a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the
party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)</p>
<p>This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.</p>
<p>3.1 Updates, Fixes, and Patches</p>
<p>When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or
different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If
no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to
this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use
of the replaced Program.</p>
<p>3.2 Term and Termination</p>
<p>The evaluation period begins on the date Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends upon
the earliest of 1) the end of the duration or the date specified by IBM in either the License Information
or a transaction document or 2) the date on which the Program automatically disables itself. Licensee
will destroy the Program and all copies made of it within ten days of the end of the evaluation period.
If IBM specifies in the LI that Licensee may retain the Program, and Licensee elects to do so, then
the Program will be subject to a different license agreement, which IBM will provide to Licensee.
In addition, a charge may apply.</p>
<p>IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement.
If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue
use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by
their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply
to both parties' respective successors and assignees.</p>
<p>THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE EVALUATION
PERIOD ENDS. LICENSEE AGREES NOT TO TAMPER WITH THE DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. LICENSEE SHOULD
TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.</p>
<ol>
<li>Charges</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no charge for the use of the Program for the duration of the evaluation period.</p>
<ol>
<li>No Warranties</li>
</ol>
<p>SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR SUPPORT, IF ANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE
MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 5 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM'S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.</p>
<p>MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR PUBLISHERS OF NON-IBM PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE THEIR OWN WARRANTIES.</p>
<p>IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT
PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 5.</p>
<ol>
<li>Licensee Data and Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee
1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 2) send Licensee information or system data
to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate
written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond
IBM's obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems
to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings.
For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries
other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.</p>
<p>Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available
to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security,
encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup
and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to
any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible
for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly
provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out
of any third party claims.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limitation of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>The limitations and exclusions in this Section 7 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent
they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.</p>
<p>7.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable</p>
<p>Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, Licensee
is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to
claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract
or tort claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related
to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages
for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2)
other actual direct damages up to U.S. $10,000 (or equivalent in local currency).</p>
<p>This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for
which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.</p>
<p>7.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING,
EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:</p>
<p>a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;</p>
<p>b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR</p>
<p>c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compliance Verification</li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of this Section 8 (Compliance Verification), "Evaluation Program Terms" means
1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM
software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies),
including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.</p>
<p>The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 8 remain in effect during the period the Program
is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.</p>
<p>8.1 Verification Process</p>
<p>Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system
tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee's
use of all Programs is in compliance with the Evaluation Program Terms, including, without limitation,
all of IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for
1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with Evaluation
Program Terms.</p>
<p>Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with Evaluation Program Terms at all
sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to Evaluation
Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's
business, and may be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use
an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality
agreement in place with such auditor.</p>
<p>8.2 Resolution</p>
<p>IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program
in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the Evaluation Program Terms.
Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1)
any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use
or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Third Party Notices</li>
</ol>
<p>The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this
Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code ("Third Party Notices") are included for
Licensee's information only. These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s).
Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party
Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as "Modifiable Third Party
Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer
the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is
only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party code. IBM's
service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.</p>
<ol>
<li>General</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.</p>
<p>b. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>c. Licensee is prohibited from exporting the Program.</p>
<p>d. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their
successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee's business
contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in
furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.</p>
<p>e. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other
has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.</p>
<p>f. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation:
1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related
to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of
such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.</p>
<p>g. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.</p>
<p>h. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible
for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 7.1 (Items for Which
IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal
property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.</p>
<p>i. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in
this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or
function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 5 (No Warranties) above; 2)
the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.</p>
<p>j. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business Partners") to
promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate
from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations
they have to Licensee.</p>
<p>k. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee's other agreements with
IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.</p>

binding for the parties without appeal and will be in writing and set forth the findings of fact and
the conclusions of law.</p>
<p>The number of arbitrators will be three, with each side to the dispute being entitled to appoint one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the parties will appoint a third arbitrator who will

<p>(3) In Indonesia:</p>
<p>Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has
not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all

<p>International Program License Agreement</p>
<p>Part 1 - General Terms</p>
<p>BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE
USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS
ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE
TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM
IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES
OF THE PROGRAM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Authorized Use" - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the
Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units ("MSUs"),
Processor Value Units ("PVUs"), or other level of use specified by IBM.</p>
<p>"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>"License Information" ("LI") - a document that provides information and any additional
terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at www.ibm.com/software/sla
. The LI can also be found in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet
included with the Program.</p>
<p>"Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable
instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images,
text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).</p>
<p>"Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") - evidence of Licensee's Authorized Use. The PoE
is also evidence of Licensee's eligibility for warranty, future update prices, if any, and potential
special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide Licensee with a PoE, then IBM may accept
as the PoE the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller)
from whom Licensee obtained the Program, provided that it specifies the Program name and Authorized
Use obtained.</p>
<p>"Warranty Period" - one year, starting on the date the original Licensee is granted the license.</p>
<ol>
<li>Agreement Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), the LI, and
the PoE and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It
replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee's
use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any
conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>License Grant</li>
</ol>
<p>The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.</p>
<p>IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the Authorized Use specified
in the PoE, 2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy,
all provided that</p>
<p>a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;</p>
<p>b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;</p>
<p>c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial
copy, of the Program;</p>
<p>d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does
so only on Licensee's behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;</p>
<p>e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted
in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer
the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver;
3) use any of the Program's components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed
materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; and</p>
<p>f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support
the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if
Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to
support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item
"f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM Program ("Principal
Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program's LI. (To obtain a
separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party
from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)</p>
<p>This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.</p>
<p>3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches</p>
<p>3.1.1 Trade-ups</p>
<p>If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program's license is promptly terminated.</p>
<p>3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches</p>
<p>When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different
terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional
or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement.
If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced
Program.</p>
<p>3.2 Fixed Term Licenses</p>
<p>If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee's license is terminated at the end of the
fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.</p>
<p>3.3 Term and Termination</p>
<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated.</p>
<p>IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue
use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by
their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply
to both parties' respective successors and assignees.</p>
<ol>
<li>Charges</li>
</ol>
<p>Charges are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits
or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or an authorized IBM reseller
in advance and pay any applicable charges.</p>
<ol>
<li>Taxes</li>
</ol>
<p>If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding those based on IBM's
net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as specified in an invoice, or supply exemption
documentation. Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date
that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee for the import
into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program outside the country in which the original
Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any
amount imposed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Money-back Guarantee</li>
</ol>
<p>If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original Licensee, Licensee
may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount Licensee paid for the Program, provided
that Licensee returns the Program and PoE to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days
of the date the PoE was issued to Licensee. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject to renewal,
then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program and its PoE are returned within the first 30 days
of the initial term. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom
Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.</p>
<ol>
<li>Program Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee's license rights and obligations to another
party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any
reason by either party, Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party. Licensee
may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program's Authorized Use. When Licensee
transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard copy of this Agreement, including the LI
and PoE. Immediately after the transfer, Licensee's license terminates.</p>
<ol>
<li>Warranty and Exclusions</li>
</ol>
<p>8.1 Limited Warranty</p>
<p>IBM warrants that the Program, when used in its specified operating environment, will conform to its
specifications. The Program's specifications, and specified operating environment information,
can be found in documentation accompanying the Program (such as a read-me file) or other information
published by IBM (such as an announcement letter). Licensee agrees that such documentation and other
Program content may be supplied only in the English language, unless otherwise required by local law
without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.</p>
<p>The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted
or error-free operation of the Program, or that IBM will correct all Program defects. Licensee is
responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.</p>
<p>During the Warranty Period, IBM provides Licensee with access to IBM databases containing information
on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses at no additional charge.
Consult the IBM Software Support Handbook for further information at www.ibm.com/software/support.</p>
<p>If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and the problem cannot be
resolved with information available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and its PoE
to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom Licensee obtained it and receive a refund of the
amount Licensee paid. After returning the Program, Licensee's license terminates. If Licensee
downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions
on how to obtain the refund.</p>
<p>8.2 Exclusions</p>
<p>THESE WARRANTIES ARE LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.
SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE
WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.</p>
<p>THESE WARRANTIES GIVE LICENSEE SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY
FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 8 (WARRANTY AND EXCLUSIONS) ARE PROVIDED SOLELY BY IBM. THE DISCLAIMERS
IN THIS SUBSECTION 8.2 (EXCLUSIONS), HOWEVER, ALSO APPLY TO IBM'S SUPPLIERS OF THIRD PARTY CODE.
THOSE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE SUCH CODE WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES
NOT NULLIFY IBM'S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<ol>
<li>Licensee Data and Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee
1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 2) send Licensee information or system data
to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate
written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond
IBM's warranty obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and
problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings.
For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries
other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.</p>
<p>Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM,
2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption,
use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery
of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable
information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other
amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss
or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limitation of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent
they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.</p>
<p>10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable</p>
<p>Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, Licensee
is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim
damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or
tort claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to
each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages
for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and
2) other actual direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term charges,
up to twelve months' charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is the subject of the claim.</p>
<p>This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for
which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.</p>
<p>10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING,
EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:</p>
<p>a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;</p>
<p>b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR</p>
<p>c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compliance Verification</li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), "IPLA Program Terms" means 1) this
Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software
policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies),
including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.</p>
<p>The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during the period the Program
is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.</p>
<p>11.1 Verification Process</p>
<p>Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system
tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee's
use of all Programs is in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms, including, without limitation, all
of IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1)
ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with IPLA Program Terms.</p>
<p>Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with IPLA Program Terms at all sites
and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to IPLA Program
Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's
business, and may be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use
an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality
agreement in place with such auditor.</p>
<p>11.2 Resolution</p>
<p>IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any
Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms.
Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1)
any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess
use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such
verification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Third Party Notices</li>
</ol>
<p>The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under
this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code ("Third Party Notices") are included
for Licensee's information only. These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s).
Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party
Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as "Modifiable Third Party
Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer
the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is
only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party code. IBM's
service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.</p>
<ol>
<li>General</li>
</ol>

furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.</p>
<p>f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other
has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.</p>
<p>g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation:
1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related
to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration
of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.</p>
<p>h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond
its control.</p>
<p>i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible
for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which
IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal
property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.</p>
<p>j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in
this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or
function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 8 (Warranty and Exclusions)
above; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee
may achieve.</p>
<p>k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business Partners") to
promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate
from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations
they have to Licensee.</p>

<p>Supporting Programs</p>
<p>The Program is licensed as a multi-product package and includes the Supporting Programs identified
below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's
use of the Principal Program under this Agreement and within the limits of the Proofs of Entitlement
for the Program (unless broader rights are provided elsewhere in this License Information document).
The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would include only those uses that are necessary or
otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program.
The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. Licensee is not authorized to transfer
or remarket the Supporting Programs separate from the Principal Program. A Supporting Program may
be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting
Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting
Program's terms. When Licensee's right to use the Program expires or terminates, Licensee must
discontinue use, destroy or promptly return all copies of the Supporting Programs to the party from
whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee downloaded the Supporting Programs, Licensee should
contact the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee wishes to license the Supporting
Programs for any use beyond the limits set forth above, please contact an IBM Sales Representative
or the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program to obtain the appropriate license.</p>

<p>LICENSE INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Programs listed below are licensed under the following terms and conditions in addition to those
of the IBM International Program License Agreement (IBM form number Z125-3301-14).</p>
<p>Program Name: IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.0</p>
<p>Program Number: 5725M54</p>
<p>As described in the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") and this License Information,
IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized
Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified
level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may
also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions.
As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without
the payment of additional fees. In addition, as stated in the IPLA, Licensee is not authorized to
use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting
or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the
applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights
may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary
terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.</p>
<p>Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information
sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.</p>
<p>Supporting Programs</p>
<p>The Program is licensed as a multi-product package and includes the Supporting Programs identified
below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's
use of the Principal Program under this Agreement and within the limits of the Proofs of Entitlement
for the Program (unless broader rights are provided elsewhere in this License Information document).
The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would include only those uses that are necessary
or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program.
The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. Licensee is not authorized to transfer
or remarket the Supporting Programs separate from the Principal Program. A Supporting Program may
be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting
Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting
Program's terms. When Licensee's right to use the Program expires or terminates, Licensee
must discontinue use, destroy or promptly return all copies of the Supporting Programs to the party
from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee downloaded the Supporting Programs, Licensee
should contact the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee wishes to license the
Supporting Programs for any use beyond the limits set forth above, please contact an IBM Sales Representative
or the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program to obtain the appropriate license.</p>
<p>The following are Supporting Programs licensed with the Program:</p>
<p>Enterprise Deployment 1.6.3</p>
<p>Development Tool</p>
<p>This Program is designed to aid in the development of software applications and systems. Licensee
is solely responsible for the applications and systems that it develops by using this Program and
assumes all risk and responsibility therefor.</p>
<p>Program Keys</p>
<p>For Programs which require keys to operate, Licensee may not have more keys to the Program in Licensee's
Enterprise than Licensee has entitlements.</p>
<p>Processor Value Unit (PVU)</p>
<p>Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of
PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the PVU Table by Processor
Vendor, Brand, Type and Model Number at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html)
and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor,
for the purpose of PVU- based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor
chip, for example, has two processor cores.</p>
<p>Licensee can deploy the Program using either Full Capacity licensing or Virtualization Capacity (Sub-Capacity)
licensing according to the Passport Advantage Sub-Capacity Licensing Terms (see webpage below). If
using Full Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements sufficient to cover all activated
processor cores* in the physical hardware environment made available to or managed by the Program,
except for those servers from which the Program has been permanently removed. If using Virtualization
Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor
cores made available to or managed by the Program, as defined according to the Virtualization Capacity
License Counting Rules at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/Counting_Software_licenses_using_specific_virtualization_technologies.html.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Activated processor core is a processor core that is available for use in a physical or virtual
server, regardless of whether the capacity of the processor core can be or is limited through virtualization
technologies, operating system commands, BIOS settings, or similar restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of the entitlements required for the Program directly, Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements
for this Program sufficient to cover the processor cores for the systems on which the resources managed
or processed by the Program reside.</p>
